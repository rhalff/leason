# Test enum type
#
# Enum can only be detected by feeding several documents.
# So this really depends on a considerable amount of documents being parsed.
# In general more then 10 or so, but preferably as many as possible.
#
# For simplicity of testing an array value is used.
# And we will test if these different values lead to one object type,
# however with all enums collected.
#
# TODO: cover different kind of enums here
