# Test enum type
#
# Enum can only be detected by feeding several documents.
# So this really depends on a considerable amount of documents being parsed.
# In general more then 10 or so, but preferably as many as possible.
#
# Determining enum is rather complex rule.
#  - did a value occur multiple times?
#  - how many times did each value occur.
#  - if there are many single hits it's probably not enum
#  - how many records are considered enough for learning?
#  - certain keywords have a high probability of being enum such as gender
#    knowledge of that could be used to
#
# TODO: There exists a mysql index optimizer which contains the same kind of logic
